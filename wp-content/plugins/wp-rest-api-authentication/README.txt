Protect your WordPress REST APIs from public or unauthorized access. Secure it with WordPress REST API Authentication. [24/7 SUPPORT]


== Description ==

WordPress REST API Authentication secures rest API access for unauthorized users or from public access using API Key Authentication, JWT Token Authentication, Basic Authentication, OAuth 2.0 Authentication or Third Party OAuth 2.0 provider's Token authentication Methods. Also, It allows you to login and register to WordPress REST APIs using any authentication method from the other applications like mobile, desktop application etc.

= Usecases =

* Block the public access to your WordPress REST APIs like /pages, /posts
* Authorize the API access for all users with authentication methods provided in the plugin
* Integrate with Third party plugin APIs like Woocommerce and secure/ access their APIs
* Authenticate WordPress APIs with the token / jwt token from other IDPs
* Login and register into Mobile or other client applications using REST APIs

The plugin provides an interface for applications to interact with your WordPress REST APIs by sending and receiving data as JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) objects. Also, It provides user friendly user interface of the plugin to configure the methods and implement it.

There are multiple ways to secure a REST APIs e.g. basic auth, OAuth, JWT token etc. but one thing is sure that RESTful APIs should be stateless – so request authentication/authorization should not depend on cookies or sessions. Instead, each API request should come with some sort authentication credentials which must be validated on the server for each and every request.

== REST API Authentication Methods ==

= Basic Authentication =

*	If you want to protect your WP REST APIs(eg. post, pages and other REST APIs) with users login credentials or client-id:client-secret, then you can opt for the basic authentication method. It is recommended that you should use this method on HTTPS or secure socket layer.
*	Username & Password Authentication - This method authenticate the REST APIs by using username and passwords in the authorization header with the form of base64 encoded.
*	Client-ID & Client-Secret Authentication - This method authenticate the REST APIs by using client credenrials in the authorization header with the form of base64 encoded. Client credenrials are provided by the plugin itself.

= API Key Authentication (Authentication with Readonly Generated Key ) =

*	If you want to protect your WP REST APIs(eg. post, pages and other REST APIs) from unauthenticated users but you don’t want to share users login credentials or client id, secret to authenticate the REST API, then you can use API Key authentication, which will generate a random authentication key for you. Using this key, you can authenticate any REST API on your site.

= JWT Authentication / JSON Web Tokens Authentication =

*	If you are looking to protect your REST APIs using the JWT token and if you do not have any third party provider/identity provider that issues the JWT token, then you should go for JWT Authentication method. In this case, our WordPress REST API Authentication itself issues the JWT token and works as an API Authenticator to protect your REST APIs.

= OAuth 2.0 Authentication =

*	If you are looking for protecting your REST APIs using the access-token and at the same time you do not have any third party provider/identity provider, then you should go for OAuth 2.0 Authentication method. In this scenario, our WordPress REST API Authentication works as both OAuth Server and API Authenticator to protect your REST APIs.
*	Client Credentials Grant - This method uses the OAuth 2.0 protocol with Client Credentials grant to authenticate the REST APIs, the plugin will provide a time base token based on the client credenrials authentication and you can use it to register a user into WordPress by passing the token in the authorization header of user create API.
*	Password Grant - This method uses the OAuth 2.0 protocol with Password grant to authenticate the REST APIs, the plugin will provide a time base token based on the user credenrials authentication and you can use it to login into WordPress by passing the token into authorization header of every API request.

= API Authentication for Third Party OAuth 2.0 Provider( using Introspection Endpoint / User Info Endpoint ) =

*	If you are looking for protecting/restricting access to your WP REST APIs using your OAuth Provider/Identity provider, then you should go for Third Party Provider Authentication method. It would be helpful to authenticate the WordPress REST APIs with different platforms token like JWT token of Google, AWS Cognito, Auth0, miniOrange, firebase, amazon, Apple etc and access token of facebook, Okta etc.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What is the use of API Authentication =
    The REST API authentication prevents the unauthorized access to your WordPress API's. It reduces potential attack factors.
	
= How to enable API access in WooCommerce?
    You can enable API access in WooCommerce using our WP REST API Authentication plugin. Please reach out to us at info@xecurify.com.

= How does REST API Authentication plugin work? =
	You just have to select your Authentication Method.
	Based on the method you have selected you will get the authorization code/token after sending the token request.
	Access your REST API with code/token you received in previous step. 

= How to access draft posts? =
	You can access draft posts using Basic Auth, OAuth 2.0(using Username:Password) methods. Pages/posts are need to access with the status. Default status used in request is 'Publish' and any user can access Published post. 
	To access the pages/posts stored in draft, you need to append the ?status=draft to the page/post request.
	For Example:
	You need to use below URL format while sending request to access different type of posts
	1. Access draft posts only
		https://localhost:8080/wp-json/wp/v2/posts?status=draft
	2. Access all type of posts
		https://localhost:8080/wp-json/wp/v2/posts?status=any
	You just have to change the status(draft, pending, any, publish) as per your requirement. You do not have to pass status parameter to access Published posts.
